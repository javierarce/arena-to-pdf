# Arena PDF downloader

Download all the PDF files in an arena channel

### How to use it

1. Run `bundle install`
2. Run `./download CHANNEL_URL [PDF_FOLDER_PATH]`

If the channel is private, you'll need to get an `ACCESS_TOKEN` first. Once you have it, rename `env.sample` to `.env` and add your [are.na access token](https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications)

Protip: you can also write down the path to your PDF download folder in your `.env` file
